Hang-up during usage - very often you are left stranded in between apps as phone hangs-up in between usage like checking whatsapp, email of sms2. Heats up excessively - The claim of fast charging is false. it takes almost 5 hours for full charge. Heats up even while making calls and drains battery quite fast. The battery doesn't last even 5 hours post full charge3. Battery - The claim on turbo charge is false. There is no fast charging and it takes 5-6 hours for full charge. Heats up even while making calls and drains battery quite fast. The battery doesn't last even 5 hours post full charge4. Access to common functions - Doesn't even have access to common functions like providing SMS service centre number. Have recently taken the handset to a lenovo service centre, even they didn't know, how to put in the sms service centre number.5. Lenovo Forum - Unlike other leading or even lesser known brands, Lenovo executives don't respond to the queries/issues put up on the forum.Over all very bad product to choose.

      "Lenovo K8 Note is \"on paper\" the best phone in budget phone segment. It's a Killer phone only if you go by specifications otherwise it's a total wastage of your 13-14k.The build quality is ok. Nothing in this phone is above average. Either it is average or below average.Let me tell you why one should not buy it.1) I used Jio sim for my Lenovo K8 Note. The problem is when the phone remains idle for 10mins or something it goes in standby mode i.e. if someone calls me, the caller hears that the phone is switched off but in actual phone is not switched off. The moment I unlock the phone and someone calls me at that time it works fine.So it's the biggest disappointment. It feels I bought video game for 14k. And this is not happening random. It happens every time when phone remains idle for more than 10mins.2) Network connectivity: Network connectivity is very poor in this phone. I tried sim cards from same service provider at same location in two different handsets out of which one is Lenovo K8 Note, and my observation is the other handset gets full network signal but Lenovo K8 Note always shows one-two bar less and that affects the call quality.3) Even though it is having 4000mah battery, the battery performance is very poor. It drains very fast even in idle condition.4) If you are movie/tv series lover and spend most of your time watching videos on phone then this phone will irritate you. Things is when you watch videos on this phone, the screen gets flickering every now and then. It is the most irritating thing. Even after turning auto brightness mode off, the screen keeps flickering.5) Stock Android at it's worst in this phone.6) Dolby Atmos is not doing any magic. Normal music output.7) The hard keys (power, volume, music) are not firm. It is very loosely connect and having too much play. Even your older phone may not have that much play even after years of usage.8) Microphone output is very low so no good calling experience. It may be because of poor Network connectivity as I mentioned earlier.9) Dual camera feature has nothing special. Even third party apps can provide better results than this so called \"depth mode\" camera feature. Overall average camera output.10) No backlight for soft keys. You have to keep searching for soft keys in darkness.All above drawbacks are not specific to my phone only. As I faced these problems, I searched for solution online. Instead of finding solution, I found out many people are having similar issues with their Lenovo K8 note.Apart from phone, I give full marks to Amazon for the hassle free return of Lenovo K8 note.Amazon should refrain itself from selling this phone.Hope my review will help people who wants to buy this \"Killer Phone\".\n",
